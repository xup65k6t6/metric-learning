# Metric Learning

This repository contains implementations and examples of metric learning algorithms using lifted structure loss with image datasets .

## Overview

Metric learning is a machine learning approach that aims to learn a distance metric from data. It focuses on learning similarity or distance functions that capture meaningful relationships between data points.

## Features
